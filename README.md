# ♻️ E-Waste Classification Using ResNet50 and Gradio

This project presents a deep learning solution for automatically classifying electronic waste (e-waste) images using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model and a real-time Gradio interface. The goal is to support sustainable recycling by enabling fast and accurate identification of e-waste categories.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

India generates over 3.2 million metric tons of e-waste annually. Manual sorting methods are inefficient, error-prone, and slow, leading to improper recycling and environmental damage. There is a pressing need for an automated system to classify e-waste accurately and support smart waste management.

## ✅ Solution

This project uses:
- 📸 A custom image dataset with 10 e-waste categories
- 🧠 ResNet50 (transfer learning) for deep image classification
- ⚙️ TensorFlow/Keras for model building and training
- 🌐 Gradio for real-time user interaction and predictions
